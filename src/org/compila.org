** This to do (compila)

*** TODO Error in the test files
<2018-03-19 Mon 07:45>

Are there any available test program to validate the correctness of our
compiler? The repo provided "compila.cmp" seem to not fully cover all
functionality of compila 18. 

Also from the languange spec:

REC_DECL -> "struct" NAME "{" { VAR_DECL ";" } "}"

compila.cmp: 

struct Complex
begin
var Real : float;
var Imag : float;
end;â€‹

begin and end has been switched out by brackets.

\section{Official }
\label{sec:official-info}




\hrulefill{}

The \textbf{deadline/frist}  for the second oblig is

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{\deadlinetwo, 23:59}
\end{quote}





\section{What and how to hand in}
\label{sec:what-how}


\subsection{Git}
\label{sec:git}

You will continue in the group's git-repos you did in the first oblig
(unless really convincing reasons speak against it).  Basically, you
continue with your previous code, add the new functionality, push a
solution before the deadline, and inform me when it's done so that I can
update. It's important to tell me, as I don't want to repeatedly update in
the hope that it's done.


If a change in arrangement is needed (merge of groups, or a split of
groups), you need to ask for that re-arrangement (not just that on the day
of the deadline it's ``announced'' that there is now a new group \ldots).



See also the \emph{Readme} of the \emph{``patch''} under

\begin{quote}
  \url{https://github.uio.no/msteffen/compila/tree/master/oblig2patch}
\end{quote}


\subsection{What to include into a solution}
\label{sec:what-include-into}

As before, it should be a appropriately commented repos, solving the tasks
of oblig 2. In particular needed is (basically as before)


\begin{itemize}
\item A top-level \emph{Readme-file} containing
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  containing names and emails of the authors
  \item instructions how to build the compiler and how to run it.
  \item test-output for running the compiler on \texttt{compila.cmp} as
    input
  \item of course, all code needed to run your solution 
    \item the Java-classes for the syntax-tree
    \item the build-script \texttt{build.xml}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

Of course, the old code (for lex and yacc-based parsing) is still
needed. It's not needed that both versions of the grammar, required for
oblig 1, are still supported.



\section{Purpose and goal}
\label{sec:x}

The goal of the task is to collect more practical experience implementing a
compiler, in particular, a taste of phases after parsing. It's only a
taste, as we don't have the time to get a full-scale compiler on its
feet. The language we are compiling is (as before) described in the
\emph{compila 20 language specification.} This time, also the later sections
about type checking etc, what were irrelevant for oblig 1, specify the
scope of the task as far as the language features are concerned.


As in oblig 1, it's \emph{necessary} that a solution is equipped

\begin{quote}
  with ``automatic test-cases''
\end{quote}
That can be done (as before) via ant targets. Those tests have to be
executable on the RHEL linux pool at the university.\footnote{That should
  actually not be a big restriction, as Java (and the task) is to a big
  extent platform independent (``write once, run everywhere''
  \ldots). Nonetheless: Based on experience with the first obligs: it's
  advised to make this ``test'' setup early on (not after the deadline), to
  design the code \emph{with the goal that it runs also at a different
    place than one's own platform} and to test that this goal is actually
  met. The reason for that ``testability'' requirment is that correction
  will again not be based on reading code from my side, but in first
  approximation: running the test. In that sense, it's also not of primary
  importance, whether it's \texttt{ant} or perhaps \emph{make} or some
  script. Important is, that I can execute it at the RHEL machines by
  invoking a simple command.  I don't have the time to figure out how one
  particular solution is configured, started, etc. I don't even want to
  look around and try whether I find a \texttt{main} method somewhere\ldots
}


\section{Tools}
%\label{sec:tools}


The tools are basically the same as for the previous oblig, and typically
you will continue anyway with the previous set-up. 




\section{Task more specifically: Type checking and code generation}
\label{sec:task-more-spec}



The task is to extend the parser and AST generation with type checking and
code generation. The rules governing the type checking and other
restrictions are described in the language specification already (in the
later sections). The ``semantics'' is \emph{not} specified, but the
language is so simple that it should basically be clear what a compila
program is supposed to do.

The target ``platform'' is described in a separate document (which was
already made available as part of the git-repos). It's also browsable under

  \url{https://github.uio.no/msteffen/compila/tree/master/doc/bytecodeinterpreter}
\end{quote}





\subsection{Tests }
\label{sec:tests}

The tests that need to be successfully run for oblig 2 are
\begin{enumerate}
\item testing the type checker resp. semantic analysis
\item testing the code coge generator
\end{enumerate}


The tests are located as follows



\begin{verbatim}
   ./oblig2patch/src/tests/semanticanalysis/
\end{verbatim}



\begin{verbatim}
   ./oblig2patch/src/tests/fullprograms/runme.cmp
\end{verbatim}

* Instructions
<<sec:bci.instructions>>

Below is the table with all instructions supported by the virtual machine
and that can be found int the bytecode library. We use $s_0$ for the top of
the stac, $s_i$ for the next element, and so on. When the symbol
$\moredetails$ (dagger) is found after the tanme of the instruction, we
mean that are are more details on the types of what is on the stack at the
end of this section (look up the instruction there).

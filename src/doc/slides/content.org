- material based on previous years, including contributions from Eyvind
  W. Axelsen, Henning Berg, Fredrik SÃ¸rensen, and others
    

- see also the course web-page, containing links to ``resources''

Determine if programs written in /Compila 18/ are syntactically correct: 

- scanner
- parser


**** Rest                                                            :ignore:



- first part of a compiler, oblig 2 will add to it
- language spec provided separatly

- using *tools* for parser/scanner generation
   - JFlex
   - CUP

- variants of a grammar for the same languages

   - *transforming* one form (EBNF) to another (compatible with the used
     tools)

   - controlling *precedence* and *associativity*

- designing and implementing an *AST*  data structure

    - using the parsing tools to build such trees
    - pretty-printing such trees

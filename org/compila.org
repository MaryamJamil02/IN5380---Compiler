** Github setup


*** Make a new branch

2025, I wanted to have a repos a little less cluttered for the
students. This means in particular without the src of the documentation and
other stuff unused. I deleted it from the ~master~ file but kept it in a
branch. I will publish the master file (but the master file does not
contain all). It's a bit unusual as I won't merge the subbranch to the
master, at least not during the semester. But it's the other way around
(merging the master to the subbranch). One has to be carefule, it's kind of
like two separate branches, and the subbranch is not meant to be merged

#+begin_example
git status
git commit -m"--" -a
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

git checkout -b extrainfo
Switched to a new branch 'extrainfo'

git status
On branch extrainfo
git checkout master
M	org/compila.org
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
\rm -rf reintegrate
#+end_example


*** Student reposes (2025)
We first have to set up this repos (as empty) on the server.

#+begin_example
git remote add origin25-00 git@github.uio.no:compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila25-00.git
git branch  // extrainfo
            // * master 
git remote -v
#+end_example

~git remote -v~ then shows

#+begin_example
origin	git@github.uio.no:compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.uio.no:compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila.git (push)
origin25-00	git@github.uio.no:compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila25-00.git (fetch)
origin25-00	git@github.uio.no:compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila25-00.git (push)
#+end_example


#+begin_example
git push -u origin25-00 master
git push -u origin master  
#+end_example


**** Problems: corrupt

2025 I could not do git push -u origin25-00 master, there was some error. I
cloned the repos new, and it worked. However, I cloned only the main/master
branch not the branch extra-info. I pushed that one after the fact (from
the back-up copy of the probably corrupt repos)

*** Things to do


**** DONE how to remove the remote <2022-02-04 Fri 09:53>

:LOGBOOK:

:END:

I did this

#+begin_example
git remote add origin22-00 git@github.uio.no:compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila22-00.git
git branch
gut remote -v
git push -u origin22-00 master
#+end_example

#+begin_example
git remote add origin git@github.uio.no:compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila22-01.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
#+end_example

Maybe we should not push the whole history. But I did it anyway.


git remote add my_awesome_new_remote_repo git@git.assembla.com:portfolio/space.space_name.git


#Verify new remote

git remote -v

> my_awesome_new_remote_repo  git@git.assembla.com:portfolio/space.space_name.git (fetch)
> my_awesome_new_remote_repo  git@git.assembla.com:portfolio/space.space_name.git (push)

To push your changes into your remote repo execute the git push <remote> <branch> command:

git push <your_remote_name>

#git push my_awesome_new_remote_repo

See the file [[file:~/cor/teaching/compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila/src/doc/languagespec/grammar.txt::REF_VAR -> "ref" "(" VAR ")" ;; change that, a bit unbalanced][here]]. There is a problem with REF, it seems "change that".
The problem is that ref cannot be nested.

functionality of compila 18. 

Also from the languange spec:

[[../../oblig1-starting-point/compila-code/compila.cmp  
Are there any available test program to validate the correctness of our
compiler? The repo provided "compila.cmp" seem to not fully cover all
functionality of compila 18. 

Also from the languange spec:

#+begin_example
REC_DECL -> "struct" NAME "{" { VAR_DECL ";" } "}"

compila.cmp: 

struct Complex
begin
var Real : float;
var Imag : float;
end;​
#+end_example

begin and end has been switched out by brackets.

* What to do better next year.

Remarks per semester, especially list of things that I did /not/ like (but
perhaps also positive things).


** 2022




** 2020 

** 2018 (I guess)


- Grammar: call_stmt -> call_expr


- maybe better structure of the starting point

- make the handout for the oblig contain all the stuff
   which is also on the slides
- check the examples better.
- perhaps don't do the stupid ant-stuff (or at least
   get a better grip on it)

- perhaps don't call it starting-point


- I don't like the clause for ~VAR~ (at least the name), it's not a ``variable''

** Grammar

  - I don't like the call-statements: it's unclear
    how to give back return values


* Tests

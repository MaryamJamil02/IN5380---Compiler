Open up a terminal window. Direct to the folder you want to download the project in and write these commands:

### To download the project/repo:
```git clone https://github.uio.no/compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila25-06.git```

### Then to go into the right directory:
cd compila-06

### For starting ant:
ant

### Building the project:
ant build

### Run project:
ant run


When you run the project, you are running a test called complexaddition.cmp. After the project has run successfully, there should be a file generated called complexaddition.ast in this directory: src/tests/outputs.

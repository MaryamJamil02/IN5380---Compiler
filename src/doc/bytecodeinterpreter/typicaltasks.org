* Some typical tasks
<<sec:typicaltasks>>


In this section we show how some of the usual tasks are solved. As already
been show, some of the instruction classes are created by supplyijng one or
two interger values, which are the ids of procedures, structs, variables or
something that is to be used when the intruction is interpreted. For
instance, the ~JMP~ instruction is created with an integer parameter which
is the index of the instruction to be jumped to.  When an instruction is
added to the stream of bytes, it is followed by these indices coded into
$0$ to $4$ bytes, depending on the size needed. In this way a ``byte'' can
be $1$ to $5$ bytes long.


** Calling a procedure

The constructor of the ~CALL~ class has an integer parameter ~funcNum~



** Library procedures
